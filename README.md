# Server Setup

I have a Dell r710 that I bought a few years back and it currently gathers dust.

I currently have a small like 500 GB HDD plugged into it. It’s currently running Debian.

I’ve also purchased installed 10 3.5” hotswaps.

I’d like to soup it.

I’m also sitting on:
-	8 TB Western Digital Gold HDD
-	4 TB Western Digital Black HDD
-	4 TB Western Digital Black HDD

I’m envisioning the r710 doing 3 things:
1.)	Plex media server
2.)	NAS backup of all the files I’ve accumulated across my devices
3.)	It’s going to run a Python script I built that gathers stock market data
